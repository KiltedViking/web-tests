# About folder `/_to_download`

This folder contains folder structure of "CSS and JavaScript folders", i.e. `/css` and `/js`, and can be used as pointer to where to put CSS and JavaScript libraries or frameworks.

Download "distribution folder" (often named `dist`) of CSS library or framework and copy CSS and JavaScript (and maybe font ;-)) files to relevant folder(s).
