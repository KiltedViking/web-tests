                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Tools can be used to audit webpages for potential problems and 
                    performance issues, and
                    one such tool is Google's Lighthouse, which can be used to audit 
                    performance, aceeseeibility, best practices and SEO. Lighthouse
                    is part of Google Chrome's developer tools and should be able
                    to be added to other browsers as an extension.

                <h2>Acting on suggestions</h2>
                <p>Lighthouse gives an index up to 100 showing how well webpage
                    performs in regards to what it audits, i.e. higher number is
                    better. Each audit that doesn't pass usually has a link to page
                    with more information about how to adjust code.
                </p>
                <p>Sometimes it isn't possible to get full marks, i.e. 100, but striving
                    for it will then just have to be enough. ;-) (Some development
                    tools and extensions in browser might be the reason for audits
                    failing.)
