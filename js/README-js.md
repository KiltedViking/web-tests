# JavaScript libaries and frameworks

For some pages in this website to display and/or work as intended, they require that JavaScript libraries and frameworks listed below are located in corresponding path.

**Please note** that some code might be very dated, i.e. might not work or might contain **security issues**!

## JavaScript libraries (or frameworks), versions and folders

Below are JavaScript libraries, version installed and folder that distribution files (`dist`) are placed (`./` refers to folder `css` in root of website, i.e. `/css`). Libraries should be able to be upgraded to the latest version of same major version (e.g. 3.x --> 3.y), but newer major versions have tended to contain breaking changes. (Libraries in parenthesis, like Bootstrap, are JS files for CSS libraries.)
