# About repository KiltedViking/web-tests

Miscellaneous tests of web technologies, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and services offered on Internet.

This is my scrapbook for web development, i.e. where I try out ideas and new things I've learnt or are trying to learn. Some of the material might be up to 20 years old (like YUI), so please verify before using anything learnt from this repository. ;-)

Any files with filenames containing "_EXAMPLE" should have this part of filename removed and own settings added to them, like username and password or key (mainly for database access).

## About content in folders

### Folders `css` and `js` versus `css3` and `javascript`

Folders `css` and `js` contain, or should contain, any CSS and/or JavaScript libraries or frameworks used in webpages in this repository, and folder `fonts` contains, or should contain, font files. The libraries and frameworks have been added to `.gitignore` to keep them from uploading to Git server - read more below on which the libraries are and where they should be placed.

Folder `css3` contains CSS tests and folder `javascript` contains JavaScript tests.

Open `index.html` in root folder to navigate to webpages with the tests.

# Setup project

* Download CSS and JavaScript libraries (the "distribution version").
* Place libraries in folders described below.

| [CSS libraries and frameworks](./css/README-css.md) | [JavaScript libraries and frameworks](./js/README-js.md) |
