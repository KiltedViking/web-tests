# About repository KiltedViking/web-tests

Miscellaneous tests of web technologies, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and services offered on Internet.

This is my scrapbook for web development, i.e. where I try out ideas and new things I've learnt or is trying to learn. Some of the material might be up to 20 years old (like YUI), so please verify before using anything learnt from this repository. ;-)

Any files with filenames containing "_EXAMPLE" should have this part of filename removed and own settings added to them, like username and password or key.

## About content in folders

### Folders `css` and `js` versus `css3` and `javascript`
Folders `css` and `js` contain, or should contain, any CSS and/or JavaScript libraries used in webpages in this repository, and folder `fonts` contains, or should contain, font files. (As it turns out, I added the whole folder `js` to `.gitignore` and it has therefore not been uploaded to repository... Will look into fixing in future!)

Folder `css3` contains CSS tests and folder `javascript` contains JavaScript tests.

# Setup project

* Download CSS and JavaScript libraries (the "distribution version").
* Place libraries in folders described below.

[TO DO: Document what versions of libraries have been used and what folder they were placed.]
