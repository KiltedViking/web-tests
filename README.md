# About repository KiltedViking/web-tests

Miscellaneous tests of web technologies, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and services offered on Internet.

This is my scrapbook for web development, i.e. where I try out ideas and new things i've learnt or is trying to learn. ;-) Some of the material might be up to 20 years old, so please verify before using anything learnt from this repository. ;-)

Any files with filenames containing "_EXAMPLE" should have this part of filename removed and own settings added to them, like username and password or key.

## About content in folders

### Folders `css` and `js` versus `css3` and `javascript`
Folders `css` and `js` contain, or should contain, any CSS and/or JavaScript libraries used in webpages in this repository, and folder `fonts` contains, or should contain, font files. (As it turns out, I added the folder `js` to `.gitignore` and it has therefore not been uploaded to repository... Will look into fixing in future!)

Folder `css3` contains CSS tests and folder `javascript` contains JavaScript tests.
