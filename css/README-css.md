# CSS libraries and frameworks

For pages in this website to display as intended, they require that CSS libraries and frameworks listed below are located in corresponding path.

**Please note** that some code might be very dated, i.e. might not work or might contain **security issues**! (Not so much CSS, but JavaScript, etc..)

## CSS libraries, versions and folders

Below are CSS libraries, version installed and folder that distribution files (`dist`) are placed (`./` refers to folder `css` in root of website, i.e. `/css`). Libraries should be able to be upgraded to the latest version of same major version (e.g. 3.x --> 3.y), but newer major versions have tended to contain breaking changes. (Libraries in parenthesis, like YUI, are CSS files for JavaScript libraries. )

* Bootstrap v. 3.3.4 - `./bootstrap`
* Bulma v. 0.5.3 - `./bulma`
* Font Awsome v. 4.7.0 - `./`
* Foundation v. 5.5.2 - `./foundation`
* Foundation v. 6.3.1 - `./foundation6`
* Foundation Icons v. 3.0 - `./foundation-icons`
* Materialize v. 0.100.2 - `./materialize`
* MUI v. 0.9.17 - `./mui`
* Pure CSS v. 0.6.0 - `./pure`
